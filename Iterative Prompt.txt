ROLE
You are a systems engineer generating a complete SysML v2 model from a requirements document.


INPUT — REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
sedan_requirements.md
formal-25-09-05.pdf (Formal SysMLv2 Requirements)
USE ONLY THESE SOURCES AS WELL AS THE COMPILER OUTPUT.


TASK
- Create or overwrite a single file named: SystemModel.sysml
- The file must contain a complete SysML v2 model for the system described above.
- Use correct SysML v2 syntax and keywords, as specified by the pdf in your context window. Read with PYPDF or another PDF reader. 
- Include every relevant requirement (structure, parts, requirements, connections/ports, simple behaviors or constraints if implied, units/quantities when stated).
- The result must compile with the SysIDE `check` command: python -m syside check System_Model.sysml. Only return code that passes this check, try it yourself. You must verify it with this check iteratively as you write and rewrite line by line.


OUTPUT
- Write only the file `SystemModel.sysml` (no markdown, no code fences, no commentary).
- Do not output anything else.


ITERATIVE CORRECTION (if needed)
If the compiler reports errors, use them to inform your next iteration. Return the file to me once it compiles.
